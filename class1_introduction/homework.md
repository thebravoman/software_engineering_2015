## Quadratic equation
Implement a Ruby program for solving Quadratic equation - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_equation
  The program solves an equation from the kind ax^2+bx+c=0 and is run on the command line by passign three arguments:
  
    `ruby my_program a b c`
  
  As a result the program returns the solutions x1,x2 on the standard output separated by a ","
  If there is only one solution, then only one solution is returned.
  
  The program is named Class_Number_FirstName_LastName.rb where "Class" is only one capital letter - "A" or "B" and number is from 1 to 30
  Commit this solution in software_engineering_2015/class1_hm_quadratic_equation
